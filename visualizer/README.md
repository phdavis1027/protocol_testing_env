# Phonetic-Cubes
A visualization of phonetic inventories as hypercube graphs

Every language has a bag of sounds that it can use to form meaningful utterances. The distribution of these sounds is not random. 
This paper ( https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01061/full ) both studied the patterns of these distributions
and came up with a cool way of visualizing sound inventories, so I put together a way of bringing their idea to code.
