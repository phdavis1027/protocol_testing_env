- The Postgres protocol spec makes a note that a new server process is started for each client.
Since iRODS does the same, it might make sense to note this somewhere. It's definitely
not needed to fully describe the iRODS protocol, but might help strengthen the reader's
*mental model*/put iRODS in context with other well-known data management systems
that handle high concurrency.

- I just started reading the Postgres spec. I had recently decided based on experience with 
some other specs that reading specs was going to be a lot less useful than just writing one,
but this is a really lucid and elegantly written document that I think I can actually
learn a lot from.

- See startup_pack.go:34-35 in the go-irodsclient for some useful code w/r/t xplaining what the 
option field does.

- Figure out and write down what byte-order all the integers used in the iRODS protocol are assumed to be in
